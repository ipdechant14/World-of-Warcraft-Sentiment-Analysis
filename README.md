# World of Warcraft Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of World of Warcraft (WoW) community discussions using a dataset of comments from the WoW YouTube channel. The goal is to preprocess unstructured text data, apply sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques, and visualize trends within the community's reactions to various aspects of the game, such as expansions, gameplay features, and updates.

While this phase focuses on sentiment analysis with YouTube data, future iterations aim to expand to more advanced visualizations using JavaScript and deployment pipelines with AWS for MLOps.

## Objectives
1. Preprocess and clean the WoW YouTube dataset to prepare for sentiment analysis.
2. Implement sentiment analysis models to classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and key themes in the dataset.
4. Visualize sentiment trends and insights using effective data visualization techniques.
5. (Future Goal) Develop interactive visualizations and deploy the final solution using JavaScript and AWS.

## Data Sources
- **YouTube Dataset**: Comments scraped from the WoW YouTube channel, sourced from Kaggle.
- Additional data sources, such as Reddit and Twitter, will be considered in future phases of the project.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive exploration and development.
- **pandas & NumPy**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **tqdm**: For tracking progress during data transformations.
- **SymSpell**: For domain-specific spell checking and text normalization.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations to identify trends.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing basic sentiment analysis models.


## Current Progress
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed comments to remove emojis, fix spacing issues, correct spelling errors, and normalize text using a custom pipeline with SymSpell.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Conducted word frequency analysis to identify commonly used terms like "raid," "dps," and "loot."
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Began implementing basic models to classify sentiments and identify key themes in the dataset.

## Future Directions
1. Integrate data from additional sources such as Reddit and Twitter for a more comprehensive analysis.
2. Explore deep learning models for improved sentiment classification accuracy.
3. Create interactive visualizations using JavaScript for a better user experience.
4. Deploy the finalized project on AWS with a robust MLOps pipeline.
